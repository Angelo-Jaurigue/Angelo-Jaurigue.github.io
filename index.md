I am a student at CSUF, majoring in Computer Engineering, and I plan on graduating in 2028.


## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs.


* Lab #2

    The first lab that came to mind when thinking about this project was Lab #2, It was the first lab where I felt that I was first truly introduced to coding. Overall the lab itself looking back at it now is pretty simple, it was just initializing a few strings and a bunch of cin and cout statements, but I remember being quite confused at the time when I barely understood what was happening. This lab also came to mind first as my team had a few technical difficulties with Ubuntu, not having the right versions and leading to the make command not properly working on anyone's computers. Nonetheless with a few back and forth emails between us and our instructor we were able to fix the problem and finish the lab. 


* Lab #6

    Lab #6 was quite a memorable experience for me. The first part of the lab was simple, it only had one file to edit with just a few simple command lines to put in, I do remember struggling with writing the if statement a little bit, but my partner helped me to figure it out. The second part of the lab is what really stood out to me. The instructions were to make a game of blackjack, at the time I liked the idea of being able to make a simple card game on a computer, especially since I’ve played the game a few times with friends. The process of doing the TODOS I felt was quite straightforward also, I remember using vectors, writing quite a few if statements, setting specific values to cards, and determining if the player was above or below the winning threshold. I do remember struggling quite a bit with the value of the Ace, as the card can read 1 or 11 depending on the situation, but with a little help from the instructor we figured out how to properly write and if statement that would determine if the computer should pick 1 or 11 depending on if the player would bust or not.


* Lab #12 

    Lab #12 was our most recent and final lab. I liked this lab because we were tasked to create gifs and images, I thought it was cool how we were coding something that was a moving image with colors, as opposed to most of our former lab assignments that would just output text. This lab wasn’t too difficult, but it wasn’t the easiest lab for me, in the lab I was put into a team of 3 and we were tasked to create and animated gradient image in the first part, then a gif in the second one. In the coding part it was my first time using compare, at first I was a little confused but I got it after looking at a few references, along with making a Sinetable. The Sinetable for me was one of the most interesting parts of the lab, as it took values that I usually only heard in math and used them to find the values that would dictate the colors in the image. Overall this lab was an interesting experience for me and It served to expand my knowledge further.
